# sparseland-experiments

This repository is a compilation of experiments I have developed while studying sparse signal representation and ways to recover it from corrupted data.

The jupyter notebooks implement experiments that evaluate the potential of the analyzed algorithms for solving meaningful image processing problems. They are numbered in an order that go from the fundamentals of sparse representation, to algorithm implementations and real problem applications.

The `.py` files are the actual implementations of all algorithms evaluated. They use only basic linear algebra operators from packages such as `numpy` as `scipy`.
